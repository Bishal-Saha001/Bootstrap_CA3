                        <p>
                            This is an introduction to the world of dance through a ballet-inspired approach. Much of
                            this class will focus on engaging students in listening, following directions, respecting
                            the dance studio and faculty members and nurturing a love of dance as a proper form of
                            recreation that involves rules, but which is also fun. Fun, music and games are used to
                            casually introduce ballet elements to these very young students. As we are a professionally
                            driven dance studio, those students wishing to participate in strictly “fun dance” should
                            consider our Creative Movement A/B class. While all dance is “fun” this is a focused
                            endeavor and should be treated seriously. During the first class a parent may wish to walk
                            the child into the room to meet the teacher and to detach.

                        <p>We usually keep the blinds closed in early level ballet classes for the following reasons: a)
                            students continuously peer out to see if a chaperone is watching them which distracts from
                            the class activities, b) students who see a parent want to leave class causing further
                            distraction, c) students whose families are not watching them begin wondering why their
                            parent isn’t watching if other parents are watching. While we attempt to make all of our
                            classroom procedures public and out-in-the-open please follow our advice on protocol for
                            watching/leaving students during class so that they can learn as much as possible in the
                            short time provided. All Ballet B classes with registrations over 8 students will require a
                            Teacher’s Assistant. All Ballet classes with registrations over 16 students will require 1
                            faculty member and two TA’s for the safety of your child.</p>
